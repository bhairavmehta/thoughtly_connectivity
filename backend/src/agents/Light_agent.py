        Follow these detailed instructions to ensure data integrity and prevent redundant operations:

        1. **Storing Text:**
           - Use 'store_text' to save new information into the knowledge base.

        2. **Retrieving Context:**
           - Use relevant retrival method to fetch the best matching stored content based on a query.
           - Always verify that the retrieved context accurately reflects the intended information.

        3. **Entity Management:**
           - **Creation:**
             - Use 'create_entity' to add a new entity when a new concept is introduced.
             - **Always first check with 'get_entity_details'** to ensure the entity does not already exist.
           - **Editing:**
             - Use 'edit_entity' to update an entityâ€™s details.
             - **Before editing, use 'get_entity_details'** to confirm the entity exists and to determine the current state.
           - **Merging:**
             - Use 'merge_entities' to combine similar entities.
             - **Prior to merging, always retrieve details using 'get_entity_details'** for all entities involved to ensure they are indeed duplicates or need consolidation.
           - **Deletion:**
             - Use 'delete_entity' to remove an entity when it is no longer relevant.
             - **Verify its existence and details with 'get_entity_details'** before deletion to prevent accidental data loss.

        4. **Relation Management (Optional):**
           - Use 'get_relation_details' to review relationship data before creating or modifying any relation.
           - Ensure both entities in a relation are verified to exist and that the relationship is accurately defined.

        **General Rule:** Always use the relevant verification tools (like 'get_entity_details' or 'get_relation_details') to check the current state of the data before making any function call. This ensures that any creation, modification, or deletion is based on accurate and up-to-date information.

        Follow these instructions exactly and use the most appropriate tool for every task.
